# CS216-Algorithm-Design
The repository contains the code of OJ and Project in Sustech CS216 2022 

## OJ1 Stable Matching

This week OJ questions' topic is stable matching, concentrating on one-to-one matching and one-to-many matching.

## OJ2 Greedy algorithm

OJ questions in this week are about using greedy algorithm wisely.

## Project 1 Zip Compressor

Implement a ZIP compressor using Java or C/C++. 

1.  It can compress one sinle file into a zip file. Multiple-file compression is optional.

2. The compressed zip file can be decompressed successfully by professional zip software. Such as it can be decompressed by double clicking in Windows/MacOS. 

3. You can implement the commonly used compression algorithm DEFLATE and static Huffman in DEFLATE. 

4. Please submit by the deadline. Otherwise 0 score. Sumit your report in PDF which clearly introduces your implementation and the highlights, and submit your source code in a zip file. 

5. If you reference some source code from others, please state it clearly in the report and give references at the end of the report.
