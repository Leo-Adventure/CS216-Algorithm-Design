The repository contains the code of OJ and Project in Sustech CS216 2022 

## OJ1 Stable Matching

This week OJ questions' topic is stable matching, concentrating on one-to-one matching and one-to-many matching.

## OJ2 Greedy algorithm

OJ questions in this week are about using greedy algorithm wisely.

## OJ3 Simulation and Shortest Path

The question A is about the simulation of the machanism of LRU

The question B is about the shortest path of the weighted graph and reverse of modulo.

## OJ4 Greed algorithm and Distance transformation

The question A is about the greedy algorithm 

The question B is about the transformation between **Manhattan Distanc** and **Chebyshev Distance**

## OJ5 Divide and Conquer: Peano curve and Segment Tree

The question A is about the Peano curve, which is the advanced level of Hilbert curve, quite interesting.

The question B is the application of segment Tree, which is quite useful in updating the interval value and finding the sum of a given interval in $O(nlogn)$

## Assignment1 Report on modern CPU caching

Please write a simple report to introduce the caching mechanism used in modern CPUs. Try to answer the following, but not limit to, questions in your report.

1. What is the cache performance measurement?

2. What are the cache replacement policies, LRU?

3. Any other policies and methods to improve performance?

​	The report should not exceed 2 pages in font size 10.

## Assignment2 Design an algorithm to find the closest pair of a 3D point cloud 

In this assignment, I have designed, implemented and analyzed the algorithm to find the closest pair of 3D point cloud.

The procedure of designing the algorithm has been introduced detailedly.

What's more, I have uploaded the implemented code to the directory “Assignment/Assignment2/closed-pair.cpp”

## Project 1 Zip Compressor

Implement a ZIP compressor using Java or C/C++. 

1.  It can compress one sinle file into a zip file. Multiple-file compression is optional.

2. The compressed zip file can be decompressed successfully by professional zip software. Such as it can be decompressed by double clicking in Windows/MacOS. 

3. You can implement the commonly used compression algorithm DEFLATE and static Huffman in DEFLATE. 

4. Please submit by the deadline. Otherwise 0 score. Sumit your report in PDF which clearly introduces your implementation and the highlights, and submit your source code in a zip file. 

5. If you reference some source code from others, please state it clearly in the report and give references at the end of the report.
